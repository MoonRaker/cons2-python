Modules
=======

pvlib-python provides a collection of classes for users that prefer
object-oriented programming. These classes can help users keep track of
data in a more organized way, and can help to simplify the modeling
process. The classes do not add any functionality beyond the procedural
code. Most of the object methods are simple wrappers around the
corresponding procedural code.

This is something I want to say that is not in the docstring.
