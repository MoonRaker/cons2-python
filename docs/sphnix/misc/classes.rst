Classes
=======

pvlib-python provides a collection of classes
for users that prefer object-oriented programming.
These classes can help users keep track of data in a more organized way,
and can help to simplify the modeling process.
The classes do not add any functionality beyond the procedural code.
Most of the object methods are simple wrappers around the
corresponding procedural code.
