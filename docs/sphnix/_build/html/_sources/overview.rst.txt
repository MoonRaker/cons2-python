Introduction
------------

The core mission of pvlib-python is to provide open, reliable,
interoperable, and benchmark implementations of PV system models.

There are at least as many opinions about how to model PV systems as
there are modelers of PV systems, so
pvlib-python provides several modeling paradigms.

Modeling paradigms
------------------

The backbone of pvlib-python
is well-tested procedural code that implements PV system models.
pvlib-python also provides a collection of classes for users
that prefer object-oriented programming.


Procedural
^^^^^^^^^^

The straightforward procedural code can be used for all modeling
steps in pvlib-python.
