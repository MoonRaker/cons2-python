.. _variables_style_rules:

Glossary
========

There is a convention on consistent variable names throughout the program:

.. csv-table:: List of used Variables and Parameters
   :file: ../../../cons2/data/variables_style_rules.csv
   :delim: ;
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 5, 5
   :stub-columns: 1

.. note:: These further references might not use the same terminology as *cons2*. But the physical process referred to is the same.
