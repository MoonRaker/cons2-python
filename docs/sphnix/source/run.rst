Running CONS2
=============

The executable just needs to be run within a directory that contains the reference files that are within the "data" folder and the corresponding sites and weather Microsoft Excel files.

The Python code can be run by importing the cons2 library and calling the run method. An example of how to do this is given by the run_cons2.py script. The input file requirements are the same as with the executable, the reference, site, and weather files all need to be present in the directory in which the script is being run.
